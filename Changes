    recreate the object.
  * DEPRECATION WARNING!
    - Gettext.pm
        * path_add        -> add_path

    - Auto.pm
        * lexicon_get     -> get_lexicon

0.00012 22 Mar 2010
  * Remove the use of AttributeHelpers -- doing this in Moose/Mouse is a pain
  * Move POD tests to xt
  * Factor out Gettext parser (Dave Rolsky)
  * Only load Gettext lexicons for new paths in path_add (Dave Rolsky)

  * Allow method calls for Maketext formats (UNTESTED -- will do more hacking)

0.00010 17 Aug 2009
  * Allow method calls to be made for Gettext formats. For example,
    %foo(1,2,3) will call $localizer->foo(undef, ['1', '2', '3']), and use
    its return value as the localized text (UNTESTED -- will do more hacking)

0.00009 05 Aug 2009
  * Do not allow superfluous entries in the lexicon hash for gettext

0.00006 14 Apr 2009
  * Properly cleanse $lang before using it as a namespace

0.00006_01 25 Mar 2009
  * Add a storage backend. This is mainly to cover cases where storing
    many lexicons on memory is not a practical choice
  * API change: lexicon_get() now accepts 2 arguments, and expects
    the translated lexicon back

0.00005 09 Mar 2009
  * Any::Moose me! Requires MouseX::AttributeHandlers and Mouse 0.19

0.00004 04 Mar 2009

    will not show up on the formatted string.

0.00002 22 Feb 2009
