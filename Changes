Changes
=======

0.00010 17 Aug 2009
  * Allow method calls to be made for Gettext formats. For example,
    %foo(1,2,3) will call $localizer->foo(undef, ['1', '2', '3']), and use
    its return value as the localized text

0.00009 05 Aug 2009
  * Do not allow spurfulous entries in the lexicon hash for gettext

0.00008 04 Aug 2009
  * Add auto_style to determine the auto-fallback style

0.00007 15 Apr 2009
  * Properly handle BerkeleyDB dependency (it's not required)

0.00006 14 Apr 2009
  * Properly cleanse $lang before using it as a namespace

0.00006_01 25 Mar 2009
  * Add a storage backend. This is mainly to cover cases where storing
    many lexicons on memory is not a practical choice
  * API change: lexicon_get() now accepts 2 arguments, and expects
    the translated lexicon back

0.00005 09 Mar 2009
  * Any::Moose me! Requires MouseX::AttributeHandlers and Mouse 0.19

0.00004 04 Mar 2009

  * Fix up POD tests

0.00003 25 Feb 2009
  * format_string() was not properly formatting for cases where the argument
    was a logical false, such as 0. This has been fixed, but note that undef
    will not show up on the formatted string.

0.00002 22 Feb 2009
  * Change the eval call, to see if we can trap failures like this
    http://www.nntp.perl.org/group/perl.cpan.testers/2009/02/msg3321095.html
